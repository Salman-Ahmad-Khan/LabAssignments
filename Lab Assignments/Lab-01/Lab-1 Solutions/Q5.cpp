Q5:
Write a program to process weekly employee time cards for all employees of an
organization. Each employee will have three data items: an identification number, the
hourly wage rate, and the number of hours worked during a given week. Each employee is
to be paid time and a half for all hours worked over 40. A tax amount of 3.625% of gross
salary will be deducted. The program output should show the employeeâ€™s number and net
pay. Display the total payroll and the average amount paid at the end of the run.
