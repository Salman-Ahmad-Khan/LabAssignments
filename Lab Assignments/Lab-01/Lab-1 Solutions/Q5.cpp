Q5:
Write a program to process weekly employee time cards for all employees of an
organization. Each employee will have three data items: an identification number, the
hourly wage rate, and the number of hours worked during a given week. Each employee is
to be paid time and a half for all hours worked over 40. A tax amount of 3.625% of gross
salary will be deducted. The program output should show the employee’s number and net
pay. Display the total payroll and the average amount paid at the end of the run.
