 A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the
area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a program that uses a
structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure
phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user
input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers.
